Hi, I am Chris Smith, a software developer student at Turing School of Software and Design.

My background includes experience as a small business owner, and a government and business technology manager.

My business, Zenio was focused on providing nonprofits and socially minded organizations a full-service online and technology strategy.

I enjoy tackling tough technical challenges as well as teaching and explaining those solutions.
